# ARIA-WRE
Artificial Rendering and Image Analysis-with-Wave Reversed Engineering

AI system designed to transform images into sketches and provide a step-by-step replay of the sketching process. ARIA leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze image content, generate corresponding sketches, and create a sequence of steps that mimic the process of sketching by hand. This technology has potential applications in art education, digital art creation, and more. However, it also raises important ethical considerations, particularly regarding the potential for misuse in falsely claiming authorship of AI-generated art. To address this, we propose that any use of ARIA for AI drawings step recovery should be properly tagged as such.
